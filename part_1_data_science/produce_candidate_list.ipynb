    "### 2. Sample Metadata (`sample_metadata.csv`)\n",
    "- Contains metadata about the samples\n",
    "- Each row represents a sample\n",
    "- The columns are:\n",
    "  - Sample_id (unique identifier for each sample)\n",
    "  - Sample_type (e.g., root, leaf, etc.)\n",
    "  - Customer_id (unique identifier for each customer)\n",
    "  - System_type (Deep water, Ebb and flow, etc.)\n",
